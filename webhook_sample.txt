# Razorpay webhook/sample server (placeholder)
# Suggested: Implement a small Node.js server that creates Payment Links and verifies webhooks.
# Example flow:
# 1) Use Razorpay Orders / Payment Links API on your server with your secret key.
# 2) On successful payment webhook, verify signature and update Firestore record.
# See Razorpay docs for sample code.
